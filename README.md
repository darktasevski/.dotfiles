# Personal dotfiles

> For Manjaro Deepin, OSX and OpenSUSE tumbleweed

This is refactored and upgraded version of my [old dotfiles](#). This is a set of config files and tools I'm using (almost) everyday. Feel free to fork/clone this repo but take care that many of this configs are tailored to my own taste.

### Prerequisites

Some of the tools are required to be installed before executing dotfiles shellscripts. Those are:

- `git`
- `vim`
- `ruby`  
- `python` 
- `curl` 
- `wget` 

Most of these tools are usually pre-installed on UNIX distributions, and if not those will usually be installed by running system update:

- `brew update && brew upgrade` - OSX
- `sudo zypper update` - OpenSUSE
- `sudo pacman -Syyu` - Manjaro

~~[Fish](http://fishshell.com/) - finally, a command line shell for the 90s.~~

[Zsh](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/zsh) - Zsh is a powerful shell that operates as both an interactive shell and as a scripting language interpreter.

[Terminator](https://launchpad.net/terminator) - the robot future of terminals.
