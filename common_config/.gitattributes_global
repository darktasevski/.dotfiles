# gitattributes in each repo is a better solution: https://git-scm.com/docs/gitattributes
# Just `echo '* text=auto' >> .gitattributes` # will normalize all text files
#
# Excerpt from https://help.github.com/articles/dealing-with-line-endings:
#    > The advantage of a .gitattributes file is that your line configurations are associated with your repository. 
#    > You don't need to worry about whether or not collaborators have the same line ending settings that you do.
